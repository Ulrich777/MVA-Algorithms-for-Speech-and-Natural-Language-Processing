# MVA-Algorithms-for-Speech-and-Natural-Language-Processing-TP2

* **HW1**: Speech Commands Reognition using MFCC and Melfilterbanks. In the first part of this project, we tuned a simple MLP to classify single voice commands. In the second part we dealt with segmented voice commands based on the previous MLP based, a built language model and various decoding algorithms, i.e beam search and Viterbi, greedy decoding.

* **HW2**: Build a probabilistic parser for French robust to unknown words. First we implement an OOV module able to map a POS tag of unknown word. Second, we implemented from scratch probabilistic CYK algorithm to estimate the most likely parsing of a sentence given a training corpus.
